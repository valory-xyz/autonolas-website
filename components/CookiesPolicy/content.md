### Hotjar cookies

Our Websites use cookies associated with Hotjar. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our Websites. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.

These cookies apply when the Hotjar Tracking Code has been loaded and ensure the Hotjar Tracking Code functions correctly. Mentions of site_id refer to the unique ID allocated to an individual site when it is created in Hotjar.

In order for Hotjar features and tools to function correctly, all the cookies listed below (source [here](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/6952777582999-Cookies-Set-by-the-Hotjar-Tracking-Code#:~:text=Hotjar%20Tracking%20Code%20cookies%20are,installed%20the%20Hotjar%20Tracking%20Code.)) should be allowed.
